This program is to run the housing game.  Rules are as follows, Guessing the correct house nets 4 points, Guessing a house in the correct neighborhood nets 1 point.  If you predict all freshman are in the quad, you get a bonus point.

In order to run this, first create a google survey.  Google survey must require email.  First question must be name.  Then have each person guess what house each freshman is going to get with a dropdown.  options must have actual full name of house in them to work (dont put full name in two different options).  export as csv

To adapt to new years, change the freshman in the freshman list.  make sure that the freshman in the list are in the same order as was asked in the survey. change freshmanhouses in the helper functions to the houses each freshman got.

Then running housing.py should create a results file.
